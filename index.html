        <h1> Welcome!</h1>

        <p> Despite the name, we're not too vicious. However, we do know how vicious it can be to hop on a bike for the first time or to navigate through the process of finding the right
            bike for you. There's a lot to take into consideration and a lot of choices out there, but we like to think that we provide just the place to figure that out
            and get you riding. We take pride in our work and the services we provide. Our diverse staff has been helping customers hop on a bike and keep them riding for over 
            twenty-fives years and we plan to keep that cruising.  
        </p><br>

        <h2>-Our Philosophy-</h2>
        <p> 
            Our philosophy is simple. We believe that riding a bike can mean different things to different people. It can be a little intimidiating to get into, but we are driven 
            to teach our customers the ins and outs of this wonderful lifestyle. We offer a variety of bikes to fit your needs and lifestyle so that when you choose a bike, 
            you are choosing the perfect match. We also offer a variety of services ranging from tune-ups to workshops.
